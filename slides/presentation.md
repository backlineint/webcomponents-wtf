# What are web components

How do they differ from 'components'

Like React, right? Well not really.

---

# I'm not an expert

---

I want to learn why I'm not using this stuff

This should be the component lover's dream

# An example - caniuse

---

# Using a web component

* NPM Install the thing
* A custom element
* The Shadow DOM
  * Drop it into a MAGA style website

---

# Building a web component

* election tracker example

---

# Buildless steps

* Hello world - just render text to the screen
  * Limitation - Sure would like to use templating
  * What happened to the template spec?
* Take in and render props
  * Limitation - attributes are only strings
* Re-render based on changes

# Pros and Cons to Going Buildless

Pros:
* More browser native

Cons:
* Build tools can actually be really nice.
* Frameworks take care of tons of boilerplate.

---

# Compare Buildless to Framework

Examples of boilerplate that framework takes care of

* Templating
* Parsing data types
* Observing properties

---

# So. Many. Frameworks.

---

# Polymer

* Lit Element
* Lit HTML

---

# Stencil

# Using web components with a framework

# My more educated views on web components

On an infinite timescale, web components will win.

But how infinite? And will it be this version of Web Components?
