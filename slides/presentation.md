along with the NEDCamp BOF Session

# Web components

__A set of web platform APIs__, not tied to a specific framework

* Custom elements
* Shadow DOM
* HTML Templates

# I :heart: components.

# So I should :heart: Web Components.

# So why aren't they part of my workflow? :cold_sweat:

# An example - caniuse

^ Web components in the wild as well

---

# I should build one.

^ What have I been lookinga at forever... Show storybook gif

---

# How would you use it?

* NPM Install the thing
* A custom element
* The Shadow DOM
  * Drop it into a MAGA style website

^ A codepen that uses it.

---

# Building The Election Tracker - Vanilla JS

* election tracker example

^ May need to experiment with <template> here to make code less awful.

---

# steps

* Hello world - just render text to the screen
  * Limitation - Sure would like to use templating
  * What happened to the template spec? Homework.
* Take in and render props
  * Limitation - attributes are only strings
* Re-render based on changes

---

# Compare Vanilla to Framework

Vanilla Pros:
* More browser native

Examples of boilerplate that framework takes care of

* Templating
* Parsing data types
* Observing properties

---

# So. Many. Frameworks.

Were web components even meant to be used without a framework?

---

# Rebuilding as Lit Element

* Lit Element
* Lit HTML

---

# Stencil

Quick look.

---

# Using web components with a framework

Didn't do my homework?

---

# My more educated views on web components

I'd use a framework, but one that is pretty close to the spec.

On an infinite timescale, web components will win.

But how infinite? And will it be this version of Web Components?

^ I know how lit element converts to standard web component stuff if Google goes out of business.
