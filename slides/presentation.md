* Shadow DOM

# I should build an example web component.

But what could be a relevant example in November 2020?

## My own personal election tracker

![inline autoplay loop](images/storybook.mp4)

---

# How would you use it?

* NPM Install the thing
* A custom element
* The Shadow DOM
  * Drop it into a MAGA style website

^ A codepen that uses it.

---

# Building The Election Tracker - Vanilla JS

* election tracker example

^ May need to experiment with <template> here to make code less awful.

---

# steps

* Hello world - just render text to the screen
  * Limitation - Sure would like to use templating
  * What happened to the template spec? Homework.
* Take in and render props
  * Limitation - attributes are only strings
* Re-render based on changes

---

# Compare Vanilla to Framework

Vanilla Pros:
* More browser native

Examples of boilerplate that framework takes care of

* Templating
* Parsing data types
* Observing properties

---

# So. Many. Frameworks.

Were web components even meant to be used without a framework?

---

# Rebuilding as Lit Element

* Lit Element
* Lit HTML

---
# Stencil

Quick look.

---

# Vue with web components as a compile target

^ examples that get to far from the spec. You still need to load vue

---

# Using web components with a framework

Didn't do my homework?

---

Why aren't I using web components

Why would I use web components.

---

# My more educated views on web components

I'd use a framework, but one that is pretty close to the spec.

On an infinite timescale, web components will win.

But how infinite? And will it be this version of Web Components?

^ I know how lit element converts to standard web component stuff if Google goes out of business.
